Bridge Mode : 


Bridge mode allows a Wi-Fi device (like an access point or router) to connect two separate networks, effectively "bridging" them so they can communicate as if they were part of the same network.


   Working : 
         The device in bridge mode connects to the main router or network (usually via a wired or wireless connection) and extends the network to another segment.
          It does not create a new subnet; instead, it keeps all devices on the same IP subnet, meaning devices on both sides of the bridge can communicate directly.
 Typically used with a wired connection between the main router and the device in bridge mode, though some setups support wireless bridging (e.g., using WDS - Wireless Distribution System).
  
  Points :   
* Does not rebroadcast the Wi-Fi signal (unless using wireless bridging).
* Devices in bridge mode often disable their DHCP server to avoid IP conflicts, relying on the main router for IP address assignment.
* Primarily focuses on connecting networks, not extending Wi-Fi coverage.


Repeater Mode


Repeater mode allows a Wi-Fi device to extend the range of an existing wireless network by receiving the Wi-Fi signal from the main router and rebroadcasting it to cover a larger area.


  Working : 
        The device in repeater mode wirelessly connects to the main router, captures its Wi-Fi signal, and retransmits it to areas with weak or no signal.
It effectively doubles the coverage area of the Wi-Fi network but often at the cost of reduced bandwidth (since the repeater uses the same wireless channel to both receive and transmit).
The repeater may use the same SSID as the main router or create a new SSID for the extended network.


  Points : 
* Rebroadcasts the Wi-Fi signal to extend coverage.
* Typically wireless (no Ethernet cable needed between the repeater and the main router).
* Can reduce network speed because the repeater has to use the same frequency band to communicate with both the router and the devices, effectively halving the bandwidth unless it’s a dual-band repeater.
