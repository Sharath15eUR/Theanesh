Basic Functionalities of a Wi-Fi Access Point


A Wi-Fi access point (AP) is a device that enables wireless devices to connect to a network, typically a wired network like the internet. Here are its primary functionalities:


Wireless Connectivity:
The AP creates a wireless local area network (WLAN) by broadcasting a Wi-Fi signal, allowing devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets to connect without cables.
It forms a Basic Service Set (BSS), as mentioned earlier, acting as the central hub for devices within its range to communicate.
Signal Broadcasting:
The AP broadcasts a Service Set Identifier (SSID), which is the network name visible to devices when scanning for Wi-Fi.
It uses radio frequencies (typically 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, or 6 GHz in newer standards) to transmit and receive data.
Bridging Wired and Wireless Networks:
The AP connects to a wired network (e.g., via Ethernet to a router or switch) and extends that connectivity to wireless devices.
It translates data between the wired network (Ethernet) and the wireless medium (Wi-Fi), ensuring seamless communication.
Device Coordination:
The AP manages communication between connected devices within its BSS, ensuring they don’t interfere with each other.
It uses protocols like CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) to prevent data collisions and manage traffic.
Security Enforcement:
The AP enforces security protocols to protect the network, such as WPA2 or WPA3 encryption, to ensure data privacy and prevent unauthorized access.
It may also support features like MAC address filtering or guest network isolation.
IP Address Assignment (if applicable):
In smaller setups, the AP may work with a router (or act as one) to assign IP addresses to connected devices via DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), enabling them to communicate on the network.
Support for Roaming (in ESS):
In an Extended Service Set (ESS), the AP collaborates with other APs to allow devices to roam seamlessly between them without losing connection, as long as they share the same SSID.
