BSS (Basic Service Set) : 


A BSS is the basic building block of a Wi-Fi network. It consists of a single access point (AP) and the devices (stations) connected to it, communicating over a shared wireless medium.

Working : 
* The access point acts as a central hub that coordinates communication between the connected devices within its range.


* Devices within a BSS communicate with each other through an Access Point (AP). 


* The AP acts as a central point for wireless communication, managing the network and allowing devices to join or leave. 


* The BSS is identified by a BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier), which is typically the MAC address of the access point.


* Each BSS is identified by a unique Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID), which is the MAC address of the AP's radio. 


* The AP also broadcasts the Service Set Identifier (SSID), which is the name of the wireless network.


When you connect to your home Wi-Fi router, you're part of a BSS. It’s a single, localized network.


Types : 
Infrastructure BSS:           Involves an access point (most common setup).
Independent BSS (IBSS): A peer-to-peer (ad-hoc) network where devices connect directly without an access point.


ESS (Extended Service Set)


An ESS is a collection of multiple BSSs (access points) that are interconnected to form a larger wireless network, allowing seamless roaming for connected devices across a wider area.


All BSSs within an ESS share the same Service Set Identifier (SSID), meaning users can move between different access points within the ESS without losing their network connection. 


All access points in an ESS share the same SSID (Service Set Identifier), which is the network name you see when scanning for Wi-Fi. 


The APs are typically connected via a wired backbone (like Ethernet) to ensure devices can move between them without losing connectivity.

Benefits of ESS:


Larger Coverage: Multiple access points can be used to cover a larger area, such as a home, office, or campus. 
Seamless Roaming: Users can move freely between access points within the ESS without interruption to their network connection. 
Centralized Management: ESS networks can be managed centrally, simplifying configuration and maintenance.
