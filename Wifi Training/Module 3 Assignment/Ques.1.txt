802.11 PHY Layer Standards 

The IEEE 802.11 PHY layer standards encompass a range of wireless LAN protocols, each with unique characteristics tailored to different needs.


* The 802.11a standard, introduced in 1999, operates in the 5 GHz band with a maximum speed of 54 Mbps using OFDM modulation, offering 8 non-overlapping 20 MHz channels and a shorter range due to higher frequency, making it less prone to interference but limited by walls.


* In contrast, 802.11b, operating in the 2.4 GHz band with a max speed of 11 Mbps using DSSS modulation, provides a longer range with 22 MHz channels but is susceptible to interference from devices like microwaves and phones, utilizing only 3 non-overlapping channels. 

* The 802.11g standard, released in 2003, also uses the 2.4 GHz band and achieves 54 Mbps with OFDM, offering backward compatibility with 802.11b and a longer range, though it shares the same 3-channel limitation.


   * The 802.11n standard, launched in 2009, supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, reaching up to 600 Mbps with OFDM and MIMO technology, supporting up to 4 spatial streams and 20/40 MHz channel widths, striking a balance with moderate range and improved speed via packet aggregation. 

   * The 802.11ac standard, introduced in 2013, operates solely in the 5 GHz band, delivering over 1.3 Gbps with OFDM and MIMO, utilizing up to 8 spatial streams, beamforming, and channel widths of 20/40/80/160 MHz, optimizing for high-density environments but with a shorter range.


      * Finally, the 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) standard, released in 2019, operates in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, achieving up to 9.6 Gbps with OFDMA and MIMO, supporting up to 8 spatial streams, 20/40/80/160 MHz channels, and features like MU-MIMO and target wake time, excelling in efficiency and performance in crowded settings like stadiums or apartments.


 These standards evolve from basic connectivity (802.11b) to high-efficiency, high-speed solutions (802.11ax), addressing interference, range, and capacity challenges over time.
