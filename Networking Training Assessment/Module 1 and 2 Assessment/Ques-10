DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configurations (subnet mask, gateway, DNS) to devices on a network. This process is called Dynamic IP Allocation.

4 steps involved in DHCP IP allocation:

3️⃣ Request	        Laptop  (Client)	       192.168.1.100	    DHCP Request (I accept 192.168.1.100)
4️⃣ Acknowledgment	Router (DHCP Server)	       192.168.1.100	    DHCP ACK (You can use 192.168.1.100)
