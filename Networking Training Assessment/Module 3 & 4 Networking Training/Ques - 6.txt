Ethernet Data Transmission in Linux Kernel
1. Start: Ethernet Device (Network Card) Has Data
The network interface card (NIC) either receives data from the network or has data to send.
2. Driver: Communicates with Hardware
The NIC driver in the Linux kernel initializes the hardware, manages settings, and facilitates sending/receiving data.
3. Net Device: Kernel Registers the Interface
The Linux kernel recognizes the network interface and assigns it a name (e.g., eth0), making it available for networking operations.
4. Packet Handling (sk_buff Structure)
Data is packed into a socket buffer (sk_buff), a key structure used by the Linux kernel for networking.
5. Receive Path: Efficient Packet Processing (NAPI)
Incoming packets are handled by NAPI (New API), which efficiently processes them while reducing CPU overhead.
6. Send Path: Queueing and Scheduling (Qdisc)
Outgoing packets are queued and scheduled by the queueing discipline (Qdisc) before being sent out.
7. Address Resolution (ARP)
Before sending, the kernel finds the correct destination MAC address using ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), and the driver adds the necessary Ethernet headers.
8. End: Data Sent or Received Over Ethernet
The network device transmits the packet to the network, or delivers received packets to the appropriate process.
